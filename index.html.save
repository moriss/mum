<h2>Current</h2>
<h3>Winter Fuel Payment</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell, Mum doesn't qualify for Scottish Government pension age winter heating payments because she doesn't qualify for pension credit (a criteria) due to her savings.
Reference: Letter in fil>"Pensions" file</p>

<h2>Utilities</h2>
<h3>Broadband and Calls</h3>
<p>The cheapest way to get free anytime calls (as far as I could see) is via a broadband deal. Alot of deals seem to hover around £30ish per month. <br/>
